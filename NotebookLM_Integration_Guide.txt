# IHC CASCADE CUP v2.17 - NOTEBOOKLM INTEGRATION DOCUMENT
## For Enhanced AI-Assisted Diagnostic Validation

---

## 📋 PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document is designed to be uploaded to **Google NotebookLM** alongside the IHC Cascade tool HTML file to create an AI assistant that can:

1. **Validate diagnostic reasoning** against literature and known pitfalls
2. **Identify additional caveats** not currently in the tool database
3. **Suggest rare differential diagnoses** outside the 18-diagnosis database
4. **Critique IHC panel selection** for specific cases
5. **Flag publication-worthy unusual cases** with educational value

### Epistemic Framework

**3 Core Philosophical Alerts:**
1. **IHC as bayesian evidence** - Not binary truth, probabilistic support
2. **Sensitivities are population averages** - Individual tumors may vary
3. **Perfect marker does not exist** - All markers have exceptions

**5 Database Caveats (NotebookLM 2026 validated):**
1. **Arginase-1 metabolic upregulation** - 12% breast mets to liver Arg-1+ (NOT lineage)
2. **INSM1 neuroendocrine plasticity** - Squamous/adenocarcinoma post-chemo INSM1+
3. **NKX3.1 post-ADT changes** - Prostate cancer therapy alters expression
4. **TRPS1 peritoneal ambiguity** - 40-50% ovarian HGSC TRPS1+, simulates breast
5. **H3K27me3 loss interpretation** - MPNST, ATRT, but also diffuse gliomas, GBM

## 🎯 NOTEBOOKLM TASKS & QUERIES

### Task 1: Caveat Identification

**When analyzing IHC Cascade output, NotebookLM should flag:**

**Known Pitfalls to Monitor:**
- **SOX10 in breast cancer** - 69% TNBC SOX10+, mimics melanoma/MPNST
- **Melan-A in adrenal cortical carcinoma** - Can simulate melanoma
- **TTF1 in rare breast/colorectal** - Occasional aberrant expression
- **CD10 pattern distinction** - Canalicular (HCC) vs diffuse membranous (RCC) vs cytoplasmic
- **CK7/CK20 co-expression** - Not always mutually exclusive (transitional cell!)
- **PAX8 in pancreatic NET** - Rare but reported, mimics RCC/gynecologic
- **Napsin A in thyroid** - Micropapillary PTC can be Napsin A+, mimics lung
- **CDX2 in mucinous ovarian** - Not specific for GI origin
- **GATA3 in urothelial vs breast** - 70-85% urothelial positive (overlap!)

**Example NotebookLM Query:**
```
"Analyze this IHC profile: CK7+/TTF1+/GATA3+/ER−. 
Tool suggests lung (48%) vs breast (38%). 
Are there caveats I should know about TTF1+ breast cancer? 
What additional markers would resolve this?"
```

**Expected NotebookLM Response:**
```
CAVEAT: TTF1 can be expressed in rare breast cancers (1-5%), 
particularly mucinous subtypes and some papillary carcinomas. 

CRITICAL DISCRIMINATORS:
- Napsin A: Lung 85-90%, Breast <1% (⭐ add this!)
- TRPS1: Breast 90%, Lung 0-5% (⭐ definitive if positive)
- Mammaglobin: Breast 70-80%, Lung 0%

RECOMMENDATION: Add Napsin A and TRPS1 to resolve.
- If Napsin A+/TRPS1− → Lung primary
- If Napsin A−/TRPS1+ → Breast primary

LITERATURE: 
- Harlamert et al (1998): TTF1 in 2% breast carcinomas
- Zhang et al (2012): TRPS1 highly specific for breast
```

---

### Task 2: Rare Diagnosis Suggestion

**NotebookLM should identify patterns suggesting diagnoses NOT in database:**

**Example 1: Merkel Cell Carcinoma**
```
IHC Profile: CK20+ (perinuclear dot), Synaptophysin+, TTF1−, CDX2−

Tool output: "NET GI (CDX2− variant) 35%"

NotebookLM should flag:
"⚠️ CONSIDER MERKEL CELL CARCINOMA (not in database)
- CK20+ PERINUCLEAR DOT pattern is pathognomonic
- Distinguished from NET GI by:
  * CK20 pattern (dot vs diffuse cytoplasmic)
  * Skin primary site (vs GI)
  * TTF1 typically negative (vs lung NET positive)
  * Neurofilament+ in Merkel (not routinely tested)
  
RECOMMENDATION: Add CK20 pattern note to morphology,
confirm skin/subcutaneous site, consider neurofilament."
```

**Example 2: Clear Cell Sarcoma of Soft Tissue**
```
IHC Profile: S100+, SOX10+, HMB45+, Melan-A+, Desmin−

Tool output: "Melanoma 85%"

NotebookLM should flag:
"⚠️ DIFFERENTIAL: Clear Cell Sarcoma (not in database)
- Morphology: Nests/fascicles, wreath-like giant cells
- IHC: Identical to melanoma (melanocytic markers+)
- EWSR1-ATF1 fusion (t(12;22)) diagnostic
- Clinical: Soft tissue mass in young adults, aggressive
- Distinguished from melanoma by:
  * Lack of epidermal involvement
  * Specific location (tendon/aponeurosis)
  * Molecular: EWSR1-ATF1 (vs BRAF/NRAS in melanoma)
  
RECOMMENDATION: If soft tissue without skin involvement,
strongly consider clear cell sarcoma, order FISH for EWSR1."
```

**Example 3: Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma**
```
IHC Profile: CK+, CD31+, ERG+, CD34+

Tool output: "No high-confidence diagnosis (CK+ sarcoma?)"

NotebookLM should flag:
"⚠️ EPITHELIOID VASCULAR TUMOR - Consider EHE
- Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma: CK+/CD31+/ERG+ combination
- WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion (90% cases) diagnostic
- Morphology: Epithelioid cells in myxohyaline stroma, 
             intracytoplasmic lumina (blister cells)
- DDx: Epithelioid angiosarcoma (more pleomorphic, worse prognosis)
       Carcinoma (vascular markers negative)
       
RECOMMENDATION: If vascular markers CD31+/ERG+ with CK+,
this is likely epithelioid vascular tumor. FISH for WWTR1-CAMTA1."
```

---

### Task 3: Panel Optimization Critique

**NotebookLM should critique IHC panel efficiency:**

**Suboptimal Panel Example:**
```
Clinical: Peritoneal carcinomatosis, female 55yo
Panel tested: CK7, CK20, TTF1, CDX2, ER (5 markers)
Result: CK7+/CK20−/TTF1−/CDX2−/ER+

Tool output: "Carcinoma Mammario 45%, Carcinoma Ovarico 38%"

NotebookLM critique:
"⚠️ SUBOPTIMAL PANEL - Insufficiently discriminating

PROBLEM: CK7+/ER+ pattern compatible with BOTH breast and 
ovarian/endometrial. Panel lacks site-specific markers.

RECOMMENDED INITIAL PANEL (6 markers):
1. CK7 (✅ done)
2. ER (✅ done) 
3. PAX8 (❌ MISSING - ovary/endometrium 90%, breast <5%)
4. GATA3 (❌ MISSING - breast 90%, ovary 10%)
5. WT1 (❌ MISSING - ovarian serous 95%, breast 0%)
6. Mammaglobin (❌ MISSING - breast 70%, ovary <5%)

OR ALTERNATIVE PANEL (5 markers):
1. CK7, ER (done)
2. PAX8 ⭐ (ovary+/breast−)
3. GATA3 ⭐ (breast+/ovary−)
4. WT1 ⭐ (serous ovary+/breast−)

NEXT STEP: Order PAX8 + WT1 immediately. If both positive → 
ovarian HGSC. If both negative → add GATA3/mammaglobin for breast.

TISSUE ECONOMY: Could have saved 2 markers (TTF1, CDX2 uninformative 
in peritoneal F patient without lung/GI morphology)."
```

**Optimal Panel Recognition:**
```
Clinical: Liver mass, male 60yo
Panel: Arginase-1, Glypican-3, HSA, PAX8, CK7 (5 markers)
Result: Arg-1+/Glyp3+/HSA+/PAX8−/CK7−

Tool: "HCC 78%"

NotebookLM validation:
"✅ EXCELLENT PANEL SELECTION - Tissue-efficient and definitive

RATIONALE:
- HCC triad (Arg-1/Glyp3/HSA) all positive → very specific
- PAX8 negative excludes RCC clear cell (critical DDx liver mass)
- CK7 negative excludes cholangiocarcinoma
- 5 markers total, definitive diagnosis

ALTERNATIVE (less efficient): 
- Traditional panel: AFP, CD10, HepPar-1, CK7, CK19, TTF1 (6-8 markers)
- Arginase-1 more sensitive/specific than HepPar-1 (preferred!)

CAVEAT NOTED: Tool correctly warns about Arg-1+ in 12% breast 
metastases to liver (metabolic upregulation). Exclude by:
- Morphology (trabecular pattern vs ductal)
- Clinical (no breast primary)
- GATA3/ER negative (if needed)

DIAGNOSIS CONFIDENCE: High - proceed with HCC diagnosis."
```

---

### Task 4: Literature Update Suggestions

**NotebookLM should identify outdated marker sensitivities:**

**Example Query to NotebookLM:**
```
"Are there any IHC markers published after 2020 that would 
improve differential diagnosis in the tool's 18-diagnosis database?"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
RECENT HIGH-IMPACT MARKERS (2020-2026):

1. **NKX2-2 for Ewing Sarcoma** (not in database)
   - Sensitivity: 93%, Specificity: 98%
   - Superior to CD99 alone
   - Add if considering small round blue cell tumors
   - Ref: Hung et al (2021) Am J Surg Pathol

2. **INSM1 for Neuroendocrine tumors**
   - ✅ Already in database (excellent!)
   - Note: Tool correctly caveats INSM1 plasticity post-chemo
   
3. **TRPS1 for Breast carcinoma**
   - ✅ Already in database with peritoneal caveat (excellent!)
   - Sensitivity: 90% breast, 40-50% ovarian HGSC (pitfall noted!)
   
4. **GATA3 expansion beyond breast**
   - Tool database: Breast + Urothelial (correct!)
   - ADD CAVEAT: Also positive in some eccrine carcinomas
   
5. **Claudin-4 for Ovarian serous carcinoma**
   - Sensitivity: 92% ovarian HGSC
   - NOT in database - consider adding as second-line marker
   - Ref: Zhu et al (2022) Histopathology
   
6. **SALL4 for Germ cell tumors**
   - Not in database (germ cell tumors not covered)
   - If expanding database, high-priority addition
   
7. **Melan-A/MART-1 updates**
   - Tool correctly notes desmoplastic melanoma pitfall (Melan-A−)
   - ADD: Can be positive in adrenal cortical carcinoma (10-20%)
   
8. **ERG for Vascular tumors and Prostate**
   - Prostate: 95% sensitive (alternative to PSA/NKX3.1)
   - Vascular: 100% sensitive for angiosarcoma/EHE
   - SUGGESTED: Add ERG to tool as dual-purpose marker

RECOMMENDATION: Priority additions for v2.18:
- ERG (vascular + prostate utility)
- Claudin-4 (ovarian serous second-line)
- Consider Ewing sarcoma diagnosis expansion (NKX2-2)
```

---

### Task 5: Morphology-IHC Discordance Alerts

**NotebookLM should flag when IHC contradicts morphology:**

**Example 1: Adenocarcinoma morphology, Melanoma IHC**
```
Morphology: Glandular architecture, mucin production
IHC: S100+, SOX10+, Melan-A−, HMB45−
Tool output: "Melanoma desmoplastico 65%"

NotebookLM alert:
"🚨 MORPHOLOGY-IHC DISCORDANCE!

PROBLEM: Glandular/mucin-producing morphology is INCOMPATIBLE 
with melanoma (even desmoplastic type).

ALTERNATIVE DIAGNOSES to consider:
1. **Nerve sheath tumor** (Schwannoma, MPNST)
   - S100+/SOX10+ (✓ matches)
   - Melan-A−/HMB45− (✓ matches)
   - Can have pseudoglandular areas
   - DDx: MPNST if atypical, Schwannoma if bland
   
2. **Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor (MPNST)**
   - Tool already in database! Recheck this diagnosis
   - S100+ focally (50-70%), SOX10+ (90%)
   - H3K27me3 LOSS is diagnostic (50% cases)
   - Morphology: Fascicles, perivascular accentuation
   
3. **Clear cell sarcoma** (melanocytic IHC but sarcoma morphology)

CRITICAL ERROR: Adenocarcinoma morphology excludes melanoma.
Revisit morphology or consider technical IHC error.

RECOMMENDATION: 
- Recut slide, review morphology with senior pathologist
- If truly glandular → S100+ likely false positive or contamination
- If spindle/neural → Consider MPNST, add H3K27me3
- Order molecular if needed: EWSR1 rearrangement (clear cell sarcoma)"
```

**Example 2: Squamous morphology, Adenocarcinoma IHC**
```
Morphology: Keratinization, intercellular bridges
IHC: TTF1+, Napsin A+, p63−, CK5/6−
Tool output: "Adenocarcinoma Polmonare 85%"

NotebookLM alert:
"🚨 MORPHOLOGY-IHC DISCORDANCE!

PROBLEM: Keratinization + intercellular bridges = SQUAMOUS!
TTF1+/Napsin A+ pattern incompatible with pure squamous carcinoma.

DIAGNOSTIC POSSIBILITIES:
1. **Adenosquamous carcinoma**
   - Dual differentiation (TTF1+ adeno + p63+ squamous)
   - Sample may be from adenocarcinoma component
   - RECOMMENDATION: Sample additional areas, expect p63+/CK5/6+ zones
   
2. **Squamous carcinoma with aberrant TTF1**
   - Extremely rare (1-2% squamous lung TTF1+)
   - Usually weak/focal TTF1, not Napsin A+
   - Unlikely given Napsin A+ (more specific)
   
3. **Technical artifact**
   - Cross-contamination during sectioning?
   - Wrong block processed?
   - RECOMMENDATION: Recut from original block, repeat
   
4. **Morphology misinterpretation**
   - Could be solid adenocarcinoma with squamoid features
   - Keratinization-like change vs true keratin pearls?
   - RECOMMENDATION: Senior pathologist review morphology

MOST LIKELY: Adenosquamous carcinoma, sample from adeno component.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Sample additional tumor areas → expect p63+/CK5/6+ zones
2. If pure adenocarcinoma IHC throughout → Reconsider 'keratinization'
3. Final diagnosis: Adenosquamous carcinoma, lung primary"
```

---

### Task 6: Clinical Context Integration

**NotebookLM should flag when IHC ignores clinical red flags:**

**Example: Young patient, aggressive small round blue cell tumor**
```
Clinical: 15yo male, pelvic mass, aggressive imaging
Morphology: Small round blue cells, high mitoses
IHC: CK+/CD99+/Chromogranin−/Synaptophysin−
Tool: "Carcinoma poorly differentiated 45%"

NotebookLM alert:
"🚨 CLINICAL RED FLAG: Pediatric patient with carcinoma?!

AGE-APPROPRIATE DIFFERENTIAL (15yo male pelvic):
1. **Ewing sarcoma** (⭐ MOST LIKELY)
   - CD99+ membranous (99% sensitive)
   - CK can be focally positive (20% cases)!
   - EWSR1 rearrangement diagnostic
   - NOT IN TOOL DATABASE - critical gap!
   
2. **Rhabdomyosarcoma** (✅ in database)
   - Tool should rank higher in pediatric cases
   - Add Desmin, Myogenin, MyoD1 to confirm
   
3. **Lymphoblastic lymphoma**
   - TdT+, CD45+/CD3+ or CD10+/CD19+
   - Not tested in panel shown
   
4. **Germ cell tumor (yolk sac)**
   - AFP+, SALL4+, CD30+ (embryonal)
   - Pelvic location compatible
   
CARCINOMA EXTREMELY RARE in 15yo (<<1% pediatric malignancies).

CRITICAL ERROR: Tool ranks carcinoma #1 without age adjustment.

RECOMMENDATION FOR TOOL ENHANCEMENT:
- Add AGE-BASED PRIOR ADJUSTMENT:
  * If age <20 → Reduce carcinoma priors by 80%
  * If age <20 → Increase sarcoma/lymphoma priors by 200%
  * Specific boost: Ewing sarcoma, Rhabdo, Lymphoblastic lymphoma
  
IMMEDIATE CASE ACTION:
1. Order: NKX2-2 (Ewing), Desmin/Myogenin (Rhabdo), TdT (Lymphoblastic)
2. Send for FISH: EWSR1 rearrangement (Ewing highly likely)
3. DO NOT diagnose as carcinoma without molecular confirmation"
```

## 🧬 MOLECULAR INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES

**NotebookLM should suggest molecular testing when IHC ambiguous:**

### Scenario 1: CK7+/CK20− Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
```
IHC: CK7+, ER+, PAX8+, WT1+, TRPS1+
Tool: "Ovaio HGSC 45%, Mammella 38%"

NotebookLM molecular guidance:
"MOLECULAR TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. **p53 IHC (⭐ First-line, rapid)**
   - HGSC: p53 aberrant (overexpression or null) in >95%
   - Breast: p53 wild-type pattern in majority (60-70%)
   - CAVEAT: 20-30% breast are p53 mutant (especially TNBC/HER2+)
   - RESULT:
     * If p53 aberrant → Strongly favors HGSC
     * If p53 wild-type → Favors breast OR low-grade serous (rare)
   
2. **TP53 sequencing** (if p53 IHC aberrant)
   - Confirms HGSC diagnosis
   - Identifies specific mutation (clinical trial eligibility)
   
3. **BRCA1/2 germline testing** (if HGSC confirmed)
   - 20-25% HGSC have germline BRCA
   - Impacts treatment (PARP inhibitors)
   - Family screening implications
   
4. **PAM50 gene expression** (if breast suspected)
   - Intrinsic subtype classification
   - Can definitively identify breast lineage
   - Research/specialized labs only
   
5. **HER2 IHC/FISH** (reflex if breast)
   - Therapeutic target
   - Standard of care for breast primary

ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Add p53 IHC (cheapest, fastest)
Step 2: If p53 aberrant → Diagnose HGSC, order BRCA1/2 germline
Step 3: If p53 wild-type → Add HER2 IHC, mammaglobin, lean toward breast"
```

### Scenario 2: Spindle Cell Neoplasm, S100+/SOX10+
```
IHC: S100+, SOX10+, Desmin−, SMA−, Melan-A−, HMB45−
Tool: "MPNST 55%, Melanoma desmoplastico 30%"

NotebookLM molecular guidance:
"DEFINITIVE MOLECULAR TESTING:

1. **H3K27me3 IHC** (⭐ CRITICAL for MPNST)
   - Loss in 50-70% MPNST (highly specific)
   - Retained in schwannoma, melanoma, most sarcomas
   - INTERPRETATION:
     * Loss → MPNST confirmed (if clinical context fits)
     * Retained → Does NOT exclude MPNST (50% retain expression)
   - Tool already has this caveat! (excellent)
   
2. **BRAF V600E IHC or PCR** (if melanoma suspected)
   - Positive in 40-50% melanoma
   - Negative in MPNST
   - Therapeutic target (vemurafenib if positive)
   
3. **NF1 mutation analysis** (if MPNST suspected)
   - 50% MPNST have NF1 mutations
   - Germline NF1 syndrome in 50% MPNST patients
   - Clinical history: Neurofibromatosis type 1?
   
4. **Chromosomal CGH/SNP array**
   - MPNST: Complex karyotype, multiple losses
   - Schwannoma: Chr 22 loss (NF2), otherwise stable
   - Melanoma: Distinct pattern (chr 6, 7, 9 alterations)
   
5. **NGS panel** (if available)
   - MPNST: NF1, TP53, CDKN2A alterations
   - Melanoma: BRAF, NRAS, NF1, KIT
   - Spindle cell RCC: VHL, PBRM1 (if renal mass)

RECOMMENDED WORKUP:
- Immediate: H3K27me3 IHC (single most useful test)
- If H3K27me3 loss → MPNST likely, consider NF1 testing
- If H3K27me3 retained + high mitoses → Melanoma vs other sarcoma
- Consider BRAF testing if melanoma likely (therapeutic!)

CLINICAL CORRELATION ESSENTIAL:
- NF1 patient → MPNST much more likely
- Sun-exposed site → Melanoma more likely
- Deep soft tissue → MPNST/sarcoma more likely"
```

## 📚 LITERATURE CROSS-REFERENCING

**NotebookLM should provide literature support for unusual findings:**

**Example Query:**
```
"Tool flagged: 'TTF1+ with CDX2+' pattern. Is this published? 
What diagnoses show this combination?"
```

**Expected NotebookLM Response:**
```
TTF1+/CDX2+ CO-EXPRESSION IN LITERATURE:

PUBLISHED CASES:

1. **Pulmonary Enteric Adenocarcinoma (PAEC)**
   - Rare lung primary with intestinal differentiation
   - TTF1+/CDX2+ co-expression characteristic (70-80%)
   - Morphology: Enteric/intestinal glands in lung
   - Prognosis: Similar to conventional lung adenocarcinoma
   - Ref: Tsao et al (2011) Am J Surg Pathol 35:30-38
   - Ref: Nottegar et al (2020) Pathologica 112:9-15
   
2. **Metastatic Colorectal to Lung**
   - Can show weak TTF1 expression (<5% cases, focal)
   - CDX2 strongly positive (primary diagnostic marker)
   - Distinguish from PAEC by: Clinical history (known CRC)
   - Morphology: Dirty necrosis, extracellular mucin
   
3. **Mucinous Ovarian Carcinoma**
   - Rarely TTF1+ (aberrant expression, <2%)
   - CDX2+ in 70% mucinous ovarian
   - PAX8 usually retained (distinguishes from colorectal)
   
4. **Composite/Collision Tumors**
   - Two separate tumors on same slide (e.g., lung ADC + colorectal met)
   - Spatially distinct TTF1+ vs CDX2+ zones
   - Rare but documented
   
INTERPRETATION ALGORITHM:

If TTF1+/CDX2+ both positive:

Step 1: MORPHOLOGY REVIEW
- Enteric/intestinal glands IN LUNG → PAEC likely
- Dirty necrosis, typical colorectal features → CRC met with aberrant TTF1

Step 2: ADDITIONAL MARKERS
- Napsin A: PAEC 30-50%+, CRC 0% → If + favors PAEC
- SATB2: PAEC 0-10%, CRC 85% → If + favors CRC
- PAX8: Mucinous ovary +, lung/CRC −

Step 3: CLINICAL CORRELATION
- Known CRC history → CRC met (even if weak TTF1)
- No CRC, lung mass → PAEC primary
- Pelvic mass → Mucinous ovarian (add PAX8)

RECOMMENDATION:
Add Napsin A + SATB2 to resolve TTF1+/CDX2+ ambiguity.

LITERATURE STRENGTH: Well-documented (level 3 evidence).
Tool should include PAEC in database as rare lung variant!"
```

## 🎓 EDUCATIONAL CASE FLAGGING

**NotebookLM should identify publishable/educational cases:**

**Criteria for Case Report Suggestion:**
1. Extremely rare IHC combination
2. Novel diagnostic pitfall
3. Unusual site for common tumor
4. Therapeutically relevant finding
5. Discordance requiring molecular resolution

**Example:**
```
Case: Peritoneal carcinomatosis, M 45yo
IHC: CK7+, ER+, PR+, GATA3+, mammaglobin+, PSA−, NKX3.1−
Clinical: No breast mass on imaging, elevated PSA (8.2)

Tool: "Carcinoma Mammario 85%"

NotebookLM flags:
"🌟 POTENTIALLY PUBLISHABLE CASE

DIAGNOSIS: **Male Breast Carcinoma** presenting as peritoneal 
carcinomatosis WITHOUT palpable breast mass.

EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
- Male breast cancer: 1% of all breast cancer
- Presentation with distant mets WITHOUT detectable primary: Very rare
- Typical male breast: ER+ (90%), PR+ (80%), GATA3+ (>90%)
- Hidden primary requiring breast MRI or ultrasound

LITERATURE REVIEW:
- Male breast CUP: <20 cases published (PubMed search)
- Often diagnosed late due to low clinical suspicion
- Important for treatment (endocrine therapy effective if ER+)

PUBLICATION OPPORTUNITY:
- Case report in: Breast Cancer Research, Modern Pathology
- Title suggestion: 'Male Breast Carcinoma Presenting as Peritoneal 
  Carcinomatosis: Diagnostic Challenge and IHC Approach'
- Educational points:
  1. Consider breast primary in male with ER+/GATA3+ tumor
  2. Mammaglobin highly specific (not just sensitive)
  3. Imaging role: Breast MRI for occult primary
  4. Therapeutic implications: Endocrine therapy effective

RECOMMENDATION:
- Document case with photos (mammary-type IHC, CUP morphology)
- Breast MRI to find primary
- Follow-up: Response to tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor
- Submit to Breast Cancer Research & Treatment or similar"
```

7. Clear Cell Renal (papillary type): CK7+/CA-IX−/CD10+
8. Appendiceal (Goblet cell): Chromogranin+/CDX2+
9. Neuroendocrine breast: ER+/Chromogranin+/E-cadherin+
10. Primary peritoneal serous: PAX8+/WT1+/ER+/CA125+
```

### 5. Confidence Interval Display
```
CURRENT: Single probability (e.g., "Lung 28%")
PROPOSED: Confidence interval

"Lung 28% [CI 95%: 18-41%]"

Rationale:
- Vollmer (2009) Figure 1-2 shows sensitivity errors affect Bayes
- ±5% sensitivity change → ±2.5% Bayes probability change
- Transparency: User sees uncertainty range
- Clinical impact: "Lung 28% [18-41%]" vs "Lung 92% [88-96%]"
  → Former needs more markers, latter is confident
```
